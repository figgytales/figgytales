				<p>Years ago, my original stories were made up on the spot as I told them to my boys at bedtime. They were usually silly stories, but fun. I loved hearing my young sons say, "Tell us another joke story, Dad." My joke stores (as the boys called them) weren't always the greatest. They didn't always make my boys laugh, but they created a bond between us and made for happy memories.</p>
				<p>My grandkids deserve to have some stories of their own. As a result, I've created "Figgy Tales." I hope, when my sons read these tales to their own children, a similar bonding will occur, and some smiles and laughter may result along the way.</p>
				<p>Happy reading!</p>
